The customer journey is simply about customer interaction in all aspects of the business. It is hard to keep track of every customer individually. A track in the customer journey is to assess and evaluate how well you're engaging your customers. The customer journey is a map of unique engagements that lower churn by keeping track of whether customers are moving through the stages. 

So, they are grouped into separate stages to help the customer success teams to act accordingly. 

1.	**Onboarding** 
2.	**Adoption**
3.	**Retention** 
4.	**Upsell** 
5.	**Advocacy**
