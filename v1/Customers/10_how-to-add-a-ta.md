:::(Info) (Note:)
*  The saved Task should come under the appropriate Status (**Not Started/ In Progress**) in Workspace.
*  The task with the due date for the current date is displayed under the Today tab 
* Overdue tasks have the Due Date mentioned with a red colored warning sign 
* The CSM can re-assign a task to another CSM from ‘Assigned To’. After reassigning, it goes under the Task list of that CSM. (And hence this CSM User cannot view it)
* The CSM can delete an existing task.
> For example, the Overdue tab allows you to edit and delete tasks that are past due.
* Any changes made to a task will be shown as history in the task window itself.
