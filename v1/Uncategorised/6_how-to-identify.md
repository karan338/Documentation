**Customer touchpoints** are the instances when a customer interacts with your product. A **CSM** can keep track of a customer's last point of contact by recording that **engagement** with the customer as a **touchpoint.**

Keeping track of the touchpoints on a regular basis or tracking them keeps you informed of all the consumer progress. Touchpoints after onboarding are extremely important because it is critical to keep customers engaged at this stage in order to lower **churn**. Given below are some of the features that you can use in Churn360 to grap the chance out of the touchpoint.

### Survey responses-Campaigns
Survey responses from your customer for an Campaign email is a great touchpoint. The Campaign email with a survey regarding an **ad-on** and a customer response to it can be a sign for a   touchpoint. In churn360, The response is recorded in **Campaigns tab** in the **Home page**. Send surveys is also a method in which you handle a customer touchpoint.

> For **example**, a survey about your product that you send to customers after they successfully sign up for your service or product may include both positive and negative comments. If there are any negative reviews, you can get in touch with the customer to learn more about the situation.Â Then you can relay this information to the product development team, who makes enhancements on the next version of the product.


So, If you have integrated your email application with Churn360, you may organize a meeting with the customer directly from Churn360. 

### Meetings
Meetings with **customers** and **users (CSMs or CSSs)** can be planned to assess how well customers are using your product to reach their goals. These meetings can be held **in person** or **virtually**. One of the many customer tactics is identifying touchpoints because it leads to greater **engagement** and **opportunities**. The Engagements page in Churn360 is where you can find meetings.

Making decisions for customer success based on the most recent interaction with each individual customer will be easier for you if you keep a consistent record of these notes.

### Support tickets 

Most customer interactions take place through support tickets. Responding promptly to customer feedback or support tickets is a good place to start if you want to make this touchpoint effective. Churn360 lets you manage support tickets directly within **Workspace-tickets** if your **CRM** and **support tools** are already integrated.

:::(Info) (Note:)
Although you can't currently respond to or resolve support tickets directly from **Churn360**, you can view them here and keep track of them.

### Opportunities

Once you identified a positive touchpoint, you can use this opportunity to upsell. Navigate to **Opportunities** and create a new opportunity for the customer you had a positive touchpoint.

> For **example**, if a customer named "**A company**" is monitored and noted as a positive touchpoint by examining the most recent engagement with the customer, you can create an **upselling opportunity** for that specific customer inside **Opportunities** that can help you create and manage **expansion revenue** from your current customer.
