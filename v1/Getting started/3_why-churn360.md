Everything began when we were attempting to expand our own **Customer Success team**. In order to stay up, we had to immediately expand our Customer Success team because **Document360** from the **Kovai.co** family was ramping up. We searched the market for customer success products, but we weren't able to locate any that were **easy to use**, **quick to test**, and created especially for **SMEs**. This inspired us to create **Churn360** from scratch. As a result, a growing product team like Document360 may employ a **straightforward** and **user-friendly** customer success tool.
