The **customer journey** can be seen as a map of unique engagements that lower churn by keeping track of whether customers are moving through the stages. Within each Customer Journey, you can define **milestones**,**tasks**, and **achievements** for both your **internal team** and **your customers**, effectively managing their lifecycle throughout **onboarding, product adoption, renewals**, and **advocacy**.

#### How to configure the Customer journey 
Follow the below steps to configure the customer journey 
1. Login to your Churn360 account 
2. Navigate to **Settings**→ **Configurations**→**Customer journey** (This opens the Customer journey page)
3. Click on **Create customer journey**

#### How to add stages to the customer Journey and map plays to it?
Once you create a customer journey, it will be displayed on the customer journey page as shown below.

To add stages to the journey, click on the **Edit** icon( This opens a blade where you can add **stages** and map **plays** to each stage to set up this customer journey).

**Active status** indicates that the customer journey is mapped with a play.
**Inactive status** indicates that the customer journey is not mapped with a play( This Customer journey cannot be assigned to a customer)

:::(Info) (Note:)
When we create a new customer journey, the status will be inactive by default. We need to add a stage and map it with a play to make it active

:::(Info) (Why do we need to add play while we create a customer journey? )
You can track each customer's progress through the milestones and overall journey. Doing this makes it easy to identify when a customer is stuck and find when and why, so you can get your customers on track.
