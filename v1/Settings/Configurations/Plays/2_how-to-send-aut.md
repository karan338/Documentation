To configure automated emails while creating a play will be useful while the play involves a customer side activity or task to be done in order to complete a milestone.

>For example, if a user's Play is to follow up with customers in order to get their feedback on new features, the user needs to send survey or feedback forms to every customer. This may be accomplished easily by adding automated emails as an activity while creating a Play.
