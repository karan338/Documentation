:::(Info) (Note:)
* You cannot assign the play to mutiple customers if you have selected **Events** in the **trigger criteria** because by default it only gets executed when it satisfies the play's conditions set.
* You can apply play to multiple customers only when you have selected **CSM** in the **Trigger criteria** while creating a Play.
* If there isn't a CSM assigned to the customer while you apply it from here, you will be taken to the specific customer overview page.
* Once the play is applied, and if there is no CSM assigned to the customer, **CSM not found** message will be displayed inside Notifications.
* If the play is applied and there is no contact associated with the customer, **Contact not found** message will be displayed inside Notifications.
* If the customer has both CSM assigned and a contact associated with it, the play applied returns  **Play assigned initiated** message  inside Notifications.
* If the activity or task inside an applied play is completed, **Play assigned completed** message is shown inside Notifications.
