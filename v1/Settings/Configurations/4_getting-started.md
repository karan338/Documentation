A segment is a predetermined group of values for the filters you configure to help you classify customers based on shared traits and effectively manage workflows. Data can be segmented or grouped using one of two methods.

1. **Static**: You can set  filter criteria to segment customers that are already  in the system.
2. **Dynamic**: You can group cutstomers into a segment with some pre-define conditions that works dynamically.

> **For example**, In **Dynamic**, if you set a condition where the **field** is a "**CSM name**" with an **operator**  "**Starts with**" a **Value** "A" (This would be the starting letter of the CSMs name), you will get the **customer list** that match the condition for the segment along with  **Health score**, **Renewal date** and **Last engaged date** of all the customers assigned to the CSMs whose names starts with the letter "A". As this acts dynamically, newly added customers that match the set condition will also be grouped under it automatically.

A segment can return a list of customers and their contacts. They provide insights that can help you manage your tasks for CS.
